ODiMM - Open Distributed Mobility Management
===========================================

Description
-----------

The ODiMM project aims to implement Distributed Mobility
Management mechanisms over IP (Internet Protocol) according
to the guidelines being proposed within the DMM IETF WG
(http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dmm/).

Using the OPMIPv6 open-source implementation as a base
(http://atnog.av.it.pt/projects/opmip), ODiMM will develop
the necessary changes and extensions to address the upcoming
mobility management changes in an open development way.

OPMIP is an implementation of the PMIPv6 standard:

* opmip-mag - implements the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)
* opmip-lma - implements the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA)
